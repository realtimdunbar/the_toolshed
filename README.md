# The Toolshed

This repo contains code that I made while learning Sabermetrics with The Book by Tango, Lichtman, and Dolphin. Check out the author website here http://www.insidethebook.com/.

## Installation

The code in here assumes the user is using Ubuntu. Later I plan on making it able to work on windows or mac as well.
