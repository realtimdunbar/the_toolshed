# The Toolshed
This repo contains code that I made while learning Sabermetrics with The Book by Tango, Lichtman, and Dolphin. Check out the author website here http://www.insidethebook.com/. It should also be noted that I found this code in various places on the internet and have modified it to suit my purposes and to keep everything in one place.

## Installation
The code in here assumes the user is using Ubuntu. Later I plan on making it able to work on windows or mac as well.
